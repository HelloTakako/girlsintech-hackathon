Q: What does it do?

A: This web app encourages you to do a daily challenge to stop climate change.
The UI has a map, and you will go along the route and earn points by doing daily challenges.
There are 30 daily challenges at first.
The next stage is unlocked once you finished the first 30 days challenges.
Each challenge can be to bring your water bottle, to turn off the light when you leave your room, to unplug electric appliances when you don't use them, and so on.

To finish the challenge, you need to upload a photo which shows you're doing the challenge. You can add a short description if you like.
It has SNS sharing function, which allows you to share your photo with hashtag #30daysofforclimatechange.

You can see other users' photos on the app too, and you can "like" it.
The app has a ranking system which shows the most "liked" users of the month, and top 10 users can get bonus points.
Users can report if they find posts which aren't related to the challenge. Frequently reported user will get a penalty.

Q: What problem does it try to solve?
A: Motivate people to act for climate change in an entertaining way.
Also, the app can educate people about what to do for climate change.
The app can show the example actions what you can do without a huge effort.

Q: What was the inspiration behind the project idea?
A: SNS hashtags like #100daysof***, #30daysofs***.
It's about doing something for 30 days or 100 days, or any other durations. There's a lot of various challenges on Twitter, Instagram.

Q: What is your stack?
Windows, Flask.

Q: What language did you program it?
A: Python

Q: Which part was the most difficult to implement and why?
A: The most challenging part was idea creation. At first, we had an idea that the app can record your daily challenge and share your photos of the challenges on SNS so that you can join the #30daysofforclimatechange community on SNS.
But, after talking with mentors, we found we need to make the app more fun and appealing for users.
So we added gaming features like map, points, stage unlock system, to make the app entertaining.

Q: What are the next steps to complete the project?
A: Make a mobile app.
Think about what we can use the points for. For example, purchasing costumes for custom user avatar,
exchanging with real-world products, etc.
